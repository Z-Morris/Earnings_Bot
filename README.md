# Earnings_Bot
Earnings call sentiment analysis and text extraction 

The Earnings_Bot.py script is used to perform sentiment analysis on earnings call transcripts from seekingalpha.com.
Copy and paste the URL into the GUI box and click search. A text file will be written to the same folder, containing the 
overall sentiment score, revenue/eps snapshot, and all sentences containing the keywords provided.

The current positive and negative words were taken from Forbes.com (link below)

To tailor the script to specific needs based upon each company, change the words in the pos/neg text files, 
and the keywords in the source script. 

To run the script, the .py file and the positive/negative text files must all be in the same folder.
